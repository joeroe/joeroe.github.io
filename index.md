Hi, I'm Joe. I'm a computational archaeologist â€“ I try to understand past societies using quantitative data, statistics, and computer models. In practice, that means I spend most of my time looking for interesting data and [writing R code](https://github.com/joeroe). I'm particularly interested in early prehistory, and my research to date has centered on the human ecology of prehistoric foragers in the arid fringes of Southwest Asia, between about 25,000 and 8,000 years ago. Sometimes I also get my hands dirty: I do fieldwork in eastern Jordan as part of the [Epipalaeolithic Foragers in Azraq](https://epipalaeolithicforagers.wordpress.com/) project, and in the past have worked on field research in Iran, Oman, Ukraine, and Bulgaria.
