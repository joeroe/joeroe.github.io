## Abstract

On behalf of the editorial team I am delighted to introduce this 25th anniversary volume of *Papers from the Institute of Archaeology*. PIA was first published in 1990 by students at the Institute, in order to provide a means for postgraduate students to gain early experience in academic publishing, both as authors and editors. Over the last 25 years academic publishing, the Institute of Archaeology and postgraduate study have all changed greatly, and PIA has evolved alongside them.
