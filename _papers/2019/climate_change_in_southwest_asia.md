## Abstract

The Fertile Crescent, its hilly flanks and surrounding drylands has been a critical
region for studying how climate has influenced societal change, and this review
focuses on the region over the last 20,000 years. The complex social, economic,
and environmental landscapes in the region today are not new phenomena and
understanding their interactions requires a nuanced, multidisciplinary understanding of the past. This review builds on a history of collaboration between the social
and natural palaeoscience disciplines. We provide a multidisciplinary, multiscalar
perspective on the relevance of past climate, environmental, and archaeological
research in assessing present day vulnerabilities and risks for the populations of
southwest Asia. We discuss the complexity of palaeoclimatic data interpretation,
particularly in relation to hydrology, and provide an overview of key time periods
of palaeoclimatic interest. We discuss the critical role that the vegetation plays in
the human–climate–environment nexus and discuss the implications of the available palaeoclimate and archaeological data, and their interpretation, for palaeonarratives of the region, both climatically and socially. We also provide an overview
of how modelling can improve our understanding of past climate impacts and associated change in risk to societies. We conclude by looking to future work, and identify themes of “scale” and “seasonality” as still requiring further focus. We suggest
that by appreciating a given locale's place in the regional hydroscape, be it an
archaeological site or palaeoenvironmental archive, more robust links to climate
can be made where appropriate and, interpretations drawn will demand the resolution of factors acting across multiple scales.
