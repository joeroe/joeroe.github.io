**era** is an R package that provides a consistent vector representation of years with an associated calendar era or time scale. 
It includes built-in definitions of many contemporary and historic calendars; 
time scales commonly used in archaeology, astronomy, geology, and other palaeosciences (e.g.Â Before Present, SI-prefixed *annus*); 
and support for arbitrary user-defined eras. 
Functions for converting between eras and for type-stable arithmetic with years are also provided.
