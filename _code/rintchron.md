**rintchron** provides an R interface to [IntChron](https://intchron.org), an indexing service and exchange format for chronological data such as radiocarbon dates (Bronk Ramsey et al. 2019). It includes a user friendly interface for querying databases indexed by IntChron, as well as low level functions for interacting directly with the IntChron API and other resources using its schema.
