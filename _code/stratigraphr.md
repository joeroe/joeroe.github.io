stratigraphr is a tidy framework for working with archaeological stratigraphy and chronology in R. It includes tools for reading, analysing, and visualising stratigraphies (Harris matrices) and sequences as directed graphs; helper functions for using radiocarbon dates in a tidy data analysis; and an R interface to OxCal's Chronological Query Language (CQL).
