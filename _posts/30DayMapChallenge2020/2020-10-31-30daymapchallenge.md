The [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge) is an event challenging cartographers to make a map on a given theme on each day in November 2020.

Maps are submitted under a [Twitter hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge) and collected into a [gallery](https://david.frigge.nz/30DayMapChallenge/maps.html).

I only got around to making one map, for Day 5, "Blue": [Late Quaternary Precipitation in Southwest Asia](/2020/11/05/30daymapchallenge-blue).
Next year!
