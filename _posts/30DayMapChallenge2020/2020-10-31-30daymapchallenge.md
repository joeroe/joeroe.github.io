The [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge) is an event challenging cartographers to make a map on a given theme on each day in November 2020.

Maps are submitted under a [Twitter hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge) and collected into a [gallery](https://david.frigge.nz/30DayMapChallenge/maps.html).

The maps I made for the challenge are listed below.
Most have an archaeology or prehistory theme.
