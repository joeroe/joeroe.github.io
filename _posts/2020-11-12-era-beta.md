title: "Beta release of era"

**[era](https://era.joeroe.io)** is a small R package for working with different year numbering systems.
There are a few systems in use in archaeology, geology, and other palaeosciences;
for example, the year 10,000 BCE is 11,950 [Before Present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present) or 11.95 [ka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#Symbols).
It is usually fine to store years as a plain numeric vector in R, but sometimes it helps to be explicit about which system is being used:

* When you have data that mixes different systems
* When you want to transform years between different systems
* When you need to do arithmetic with years

The era package helps in these cases by providing classes which define the 'era' associated with a vector of years and functions for formatting, combining, and transforming years with different eras.
I wrote it to support two other packages I'm working on, [stratigraphr](https://stratigraphr.joeroe.io) and [rintchron](https://rintchron.joeroe.io), because whilst converting between any two eras (e.g. BP→BCE) is trivial, I wanted something more generalised and predictable when encountering lots of them.
It was also a good way to learn more about [vctrs](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/), the new backend package used to implement S3 vector classes in the tidyverse, which I found very useful for getting a grip on how size and type stability works (or doesn't work) in R at a low level, and how to write classes that behave consistently and intuitively.

I released the first beta version of era today. You can install it from GitHub with the [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("joeroe/era")
library("era")
```

I plan to submit the next release to CRAN; so please, try it out and [submit an issue](https://github.com/joeroe/era/issues) if you find any bugs!

## Using era

The [introductory vignette](https://era.joeroe.io/articles/era.html) details the main features of the package, but briefly,
`yr()` defines the era associated with a vector of years:

```r
yr(10010:10001, "cal BP")
#> # cal BP years <yr[10]>:
#>  [1] 10010 10009 10008 10007 10006 10005 10004 10003 10002 10001
#> # Era: Before Present (cal BP): calendar years, counted backwards from 1950
```

`yr` is a vector class is based on `vctrs`.
This means it behaves in a consistent, type-stable way across base R and other packages.
Some common calendar systems and time scales are built into the package (see `?eras()`) and can be referenced by simply passing their abbreviated label to `yr()`. 
Other eras can be defined using the `era()` function directly, which allows for arbitrary user-defined eras:

``` r
era("T.A.", epoch = -9021, name = "Third Age", direction = "forwards")
#> <era[1]>
#> [1] Third Age (T.A.): calendar years, counted forwards from -9021
```

The `yr_transform()` is used to convert between eras, included user-defined ones:

``` r
yr(10010:10001, "cal BP") %>% 
  yr_transform(era("BCE"))
#> # BCE years <yr[10]>:
#>  [1] 8060 8059 8058 8057 8056 8055 8054 8053 8052 8051
#> # Era: Before Common Era (BCE): calendar years, counted backwards from 0
```

`yr` vectors fit nicely into tables, both base data frames and tibbles:

```r
tribble(
  ~period,           ~start_ka,
  "Late Holocene",   4.2,
  "Mid Holocene",    8.326,
  "Early Holocene",  11.7,
  "Younger Dryas",   12.9,
  "Bølling-Allerød", 14.7,
  "Heinrich 1",      17.0
) %>%
  mutate(start_ka = yr(start_ka, "ka")) %>% 
  mutate(start_bp = yr_transform(start_ka, era("BP")),
         start_bce = yr_transform(start_ka, era("BCE")))
#> # A tibble: 6 x 4
#>   period          start_ka start_bp start_bce
#>   <chr>               <yr>     <yr>      <yr>
#> 1 Late Holocene      4.200     4200      2250
#> 2 Mid Holocene       8.326     8326      6376
#> 3 Early Holocene    11.700    11700      9750
#> 4 Younger Dryas     12.900    12900     10950
#> 5 Bølling-Allerød   14.700    14700     12750
#> 6 Heinrich 1        17.000    17000     15050
```
