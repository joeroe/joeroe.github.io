6,000 years ago the world's largest settlements weren't in Mesopotamia, the Indus, or China, but the steppes of modern-day Ukraine.
These 'mega-sites' are puzzling because, unlike those of the cradles of civilisation, they had no temples, palaces, or other signs of heirarchy.

But research at Nebelivka, published today in [an open access book](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110664959/html), sheds light on how these remarkable sites worked. The mega-sites were places where many communities assembled in a larger collective, using an open, horizontal social order to live side-by-side.
The traces of this primordial "alternative urbanism" are everywhere at Nebelivka: in the maze of neighbourhoods and quarters, individually distinct but part of a coherent overall plan; the massive but plain assembly houses where different groups could gather to make collective decision; and the elaborate ritual burning of houses to mark the impermanence of the individual in the collective order.

Unfortunately, it was short-lived. Despite its size, Nebelivka was occupied for just 200 years and the mega-site phenomenon had disappeared by the end of the 4th millennium BCE. The later cities of the "cradles of civilisation" set urban societies on a very different path.

[*Early Urbanism in Europe: The Trypillia Megasites of the Ukrainian Forest-Steppe*](https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110664959), edited by Bisserka Gaydarska, is available open access from De Gruyter. 
It includes a [small contribution](/papers/2020/nebbia_roe_2020.html) drawn from my bachelor's dissertation.
Huge congratulations to Bisserka Gaydarska and John Chapman for completing this mega-project. They gave me my start in archaeology on their very first field season in Ukraine, nearly 12 years ago!
