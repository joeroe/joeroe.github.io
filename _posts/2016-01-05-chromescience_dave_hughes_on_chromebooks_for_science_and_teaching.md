title: "#ChromeScience: Dave Hughes on Chromebooks for science and teaching"
---

I've written a little bit before about using Chromebooks and the Google ecosystem for research, specifically [using RStudio Server on a Google Cloud Compute instance](/blog/2015/08/rstudio-server-on-a-google-compute-engine-instance/). Dan Hughes has beat me to a more comprehensive guide, with [a series on using Chromebooks to teach and manage a *proper science* science lab.](http://itchyandirritated.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/science-labs-and-teaching-with.html)
