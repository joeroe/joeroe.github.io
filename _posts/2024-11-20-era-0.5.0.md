title: "era 0.5.0: chronological ordering and extremes"
tag: R

**[era](https://era.joeroe.io)** v0.5.0 is now available [on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=era):

```r
install.packages("era")
```

This minor release adds functions for [chronological ordering](https://era.joeroe.io/reference/yr_sort.html) (`yr_sort()`) of year vectors:

```r
# Forward-counting era:
x <- yr(c(200, 100, 300), "CE")
yr_earliest(x)
#> # CE years <yr[1]>:
#> [1] 100
#> # Era: Common Era (CE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted forwards from 0
yr_latest(x)
#> # CE years <yr[1]>:
#> [1] 300
#> # Era: Common Era (CE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted forwards from 0
yr_range(x)
#> # CE years <yr[2]>:
#> [1] 100 300
#> # Era: Common Era (CE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted forwards from 0

# Backward-counting era:
y <- yr(c(200, 100, 300), "BCE")
yr_earliest(y)
#> # BCE years <yr[1]>:
#> [1] 300
#> # Era: Before Common Era (BCE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted backwards from 1
yr_latest(y)
#> # BCE years <yr[1]>:
#> [1] 100
#> # Era: Before Common Era (BCE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted backwards from 1
yr_range(x)
#> # CE years <yr[2]>:
#> [1] 100 300
#> # Era: Common Era (CE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted forwards from 0
```

And for [calculating their extreme values](https://era.joeroe.io/reference/yr_extremes.html) (`yr_earliest()`, `yr_latest()`, and `yr_range()`)

```r
# Forward-counting era:
x <- yr(c(200, 100, 300), "CE")
yr_earliest(x)
#> # CE years <yr[1]>:
#> [1] 100
#> # Era: Common Era (CE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted forwards from 0
yr_latest(x)
#> # CE years <yr[1]>:
#> [1] 300
#> # Era: Common Era (CE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted forwards from 0
yr_range(x)
#> # CE years <yr[2]>:
#> [1] 100 300
#> # Era: Common Era (CE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted forwards from 0

# Backward-counting era:
y <- yr(c(200, 100, 300), "BCE")
yr_earliest(y)
#> # BCE years <yr[1]>:
#> [1] 300
#> # Era: Before Common Era (BCE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted backwards from 1
yr_latest(y)
#> # BCE years <yr[1]>:
#> [1] 100
#> # Era: Before Common Era (BCE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted backwards from 1
yr_range(x)
#> # CE years <yr[2]>:
#> [1] 100 300
#> # Era: Common Era (CE): Gregorian years (365.2425 days), counted forwards from 0
```

Essentially these are all wrappers for base functions (`sort()`, `min()`, `max()` and `range()`) that are aware of the directionality of the era system attached to the vector: "CE" years are counted forwards, "BCE" years are counted backwards, etc.
I decided to implement them as prefixed functions instead of S3 methods for `yr` vectors because I didn't want to suprise people when they used e.g. `max()` expecting the numerical maximum and got the chronologically latest value instead.
