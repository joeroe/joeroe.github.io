I am a computational archaeologist and assistant professor in Near Eastern archaeology at the University of Copenhagen. [My research](/papers) uses data science and ecological modelling to investigate the world's first farming societies in prehistoric Southwest Asia. I also develop [research software](/code) and [open data](/data) that supports open science in archaeology. I have active field projects in eastern Jordan, focusing on desert archaeological survey, and have previously worked in Iran, Oman, Ukraine, and Bulgaria.

I am currently working on sampling early cropping systems as part of the [Ancient Environment Genomics Initiative for Sustainability](https://globe.ku.dk/research/ancient-environmental-genomics-initiative-for-sustainability/) (AEGIS) and as one of the lead maintainers of [XRONOS](https://xronos.ch/), an open data infrastructure for archaeological chronology.
