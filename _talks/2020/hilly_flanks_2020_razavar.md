## Abstract

In 2018, as part of the joint Iranian-Danish TCEC Project, an archaeological survey was carried out in the Razavar Valley, Kermanshah, aiming to locate new Epipaleolithic-Neolithic sites and to estimate environmental potentials of the valley during the late Pleistocene-early Holocene. The study area is located in the northernmost fringe of the central/folded Zagros, a region that has previously yielded a notable amount of archaeological evidence from this time. The area is a long but rather wide intermountain valley, 326.3 km2 in area, with Pleistocene terraces, mostly along the Razavar River to the south. The abundance of fresh water, raw material, and fertile agricultural lands have provided ideal conditions for the formation of human settlements, especially during the Neolithic period. Location of the area between the Bisotoun limestone mountains (Central Zagros) and the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone (northern Zagros) provided a good opportunity to evaluate its capabilities during the periods under study. For this season, the survey was limited to the old terraces in the south of Razavar River, some of the barren lands in rocky slopes, and the surrounding agricultural lands. As the result, a total of 6 Neolithic sites were identified. Of these, two sites are dated to early Neolithic and the rest contained late Neolithic evidence. No Epi-palaeolithic sites were recovered. A few localities with scatters of chipped flints, however, were recorded though their chronology is unknown.  Most importantly, early Neolithic finds were found at Tapeh Salarabad, a mounded site showing thick deposits rich in lithics, shells, charcoal, and ash. Presence of such Neolithic evidence indicates that the valley was intensively occupied by the Neolithic people. Additionally, achievements of the current survey has made a foundation for further investigations in future.
