## Abstract

We report the preliminary results of our 2018 field season in Dhufar, Oman.
Previous research has documented surface remains of stone settlement structures in the north-eastern end of the Wadi Darbat, but because few have sealed cultural levels, the chronology of these settlements is not well understood.
Our objectives this season were to ground-truth the results of a remote-sensed satellite survey, and to improve our understanding of the spatial, temporal and morphological dimensions of settlement in the region.
We devised a typology of settlement structure styles, and we tested the best explanatory model (biogeography, inter-settlement distance, distance to water availability) for the spatial patterning of these settlements with statistical methods in R (nearest neighbour, point pattern analysis).
