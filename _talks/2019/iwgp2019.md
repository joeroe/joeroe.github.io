## Abstract

Archaeologists  have  long  investigated  the  provenance  of  archaeological  artefacts  as  a  way  of understanding past subsistence. Provenance analyses of bioarchaeological materials have provided key information on human and animal mobility patterns, territoriality, and economic activities such as pastoralism. Surprisingly, the provisioning of plant resources in prehistory has rarely been examined. Where  the  plants  that  served  as  food,  fuel  and  raw  materials  were  growing  has  only been inferred indirectly, based on modern ecological analogues and the geological setting of sites. Here  we  propose  a  new,  interdisciplinary  approach  that  combines  archaeobotany,  ecological niche modelling, carbon isotope discrimination and strontium analyses to evaluate hunter-gatherer plant procurement strategies. We identify some of the plant species used as food and fuel by Natufian groups and their likely distribution in the landscape (plant catchment areas) at the site of Shubayqa 1 (northeastern Jordan). The results provide unique perspectives about the degree of mobility of hunter-gatherer groups and the distribution of plant resources in the past.
