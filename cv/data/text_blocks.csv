intro,I am a computational archaeologist specialising in Southwest Asian prehistory. I use data science to study [human ecology and cultural evolution in past societies](https://joeroe.io/papers/); develop [research software](https://joeroe.io/code/) and [open datasets](https://joeroe.io/datasets/) for reproducible quantitative analysis in archaeology; and direct [field surveys](https://joeroe.io/posters/) using digital recording and geoinformatics technology.
paper_aside,"My publications reflect a number of ongoing collaborations with domain-specialist colleagues, bringing a data science perspective to addressing multidisciplinary research questions in prehistory."
software_aside,I am also an active contributor to a number of [other open source software and open data projects](https://github.com/joeroe).
talk_aside,See my homepage for [abstracts](https://joeroe.io/talks/) and [posters](https://joeroe.io/posters/).
